        <p>
          In order to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of data, the
          Administrator has implemented procedures allowing access to personal
          data only to authorized persons and only to the extent that it is it
          is necessary because of the tasks they perform. The administrator uses
          organizational and technical solutions to ensure that all operations
          on personal data are registered and made only by authorized persons.
        </p>
        <p>
          The administrator also takes all necessary steps to ensure that its
          subcontractors and other cooperating entities guarantee the

          OBJECTIVES AND LEGAL BASIS FOR DATA PROCESSING BY THE ADMINISTRATOR

          <h4>E-mail and traditional correspondence</h4>
          <p>
            In the case of sending e-mail correspondence to the Administrator or
            by traditional means, not related to services provided to the sender
            or other contract concluded with him, the personal data contained in
            this correspondence are processed only for the purpose of
            communication and settling the matter to which this correspondence
            relates.
          </p>
          <p>
            The legal basis for processing is the performance of the contract
            and the legitimate interest of the Administrator (Article 6 (1) (b)
            and (f) of GDPR *).
          </p>
          <p>
            All correspondence is stored in a way that ensures the security of

          <h4>Recruitment</h4>
          <p>
            As part of recruitment processes, the Administrator expects the
            transfer of personal data (e.g. in a CV) only to the extent
            specified in labor law. Consequently, the broader scope of
            information should not be shared. In the event that the submitted
            applications contain this type of additional data, the Administrator
            will assume that the candidate agrees to their processing for
            recruitment purposes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Personal data of candidates are processed in order to fulfill
            obligations resulting from legal provisions related to the
            employment process, including in particular the Labor law - the
            legal basis for processing is the legal obligation incumbent on the
            Administrator (Article 6 (1) (c) of the GDPR * in connection with
            the provisions of the Labor law). If the Administrator does not
            conduct recruitment or has announced new ones, we may process your
            data only on the basis of the consent provided (Article 6 (1) (a) of
